			Q(attorney): They exceed the Federal Poverty Guidelines and will therefore not be found indigent. However, they may still be considered "partially indigent." This is the case if, though their income exceeds the Federal Poverty Guidelines, they do not make enough to also cover the anticipated cost of a private attorney. What is the anticipated cost of a private attorney?
